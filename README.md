# JSON_miniproject

**This miniproject aims at working with .json files.**

Examples of how to use .json files, as well as three exercises, can be found in ```sliderule_dsi_json_exercise.ipynb```.

I present my solutions for the exercises in ```JSON_miniproject_HP.ipynb```.

The .json files used in the examples and exercises are located in the folder ```data```.
